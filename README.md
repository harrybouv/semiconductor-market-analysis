# Semiconductor Market Analysis

Research project analysing whether the current AI/semiconductor boom shows bubble like characteristics, or the appreciation is fundamentally justified

## Content of the Repo
'paper/'; - 'full_paper_v1.pdf'; full write up of the quantitative analysis conducted

note, an executive summary and fully LaTeX formatted paper will also be pushed

'scripts/s'; Python scripts used for data collection, valuation metrics, decomposition and plotting

## Method
- Pull price/valuation data
- Compute key multiples and growth metrics
- Decompose returns into fundamentals vs multiple expansion where possible
- Run sensitivity/stress tests on assumptions
- Present results with clear figures

- ## Reproducibility
This repo does not include raw datasets or API keys. Scripts are provided to regenerate analysis where possible; any required data sources are described in the paper.

## Future Expansion
- Add executive summary ~2 pages and final LaTeX formatted version
- Improve script organisation
